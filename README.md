## Plan:
- terraform for creating instances
- Ansible to configure them
- Kubernetes cluster with monitoring tools premtheus and grafana
- CI CD pipelines with git
- some JS app where input can be seen in the monitoring
- bash, python, go
- copy/paste bash command lines to connect to specific servers/addresses
- maybe a JS app where the whole proccess from start is visually shown with servers deployed and deleted and steps
