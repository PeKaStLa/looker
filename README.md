## Plan:
- terraform for creating instances
- Ansible to configure them
- Kubernetes cluster with monitoring tools premtheus and grafana
- CI CD pipelines with git
- a tool/app where input/changes can be seen in the monitoring
- bash, python, go
- copy/paste bash command lines to connect to specific servers/addresses
- maybe a local JS app where the whole process from start on is visually shown with servers deployed and deleted and steps
